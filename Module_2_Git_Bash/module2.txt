write in your own words the answer to the following 3 questions:

a) What is Git and how is it different than GitHub
	Git is a version control system that allows the user to keep a history of the changes made to a repository but only locally, meaning in the person's computer. If that person wishes to share their repo online then that is when GitHub will come in. Using GitHub, an open source website/platform, one is able to share their local repos and make them accessible to other people. This way developers can improve and learn from each other's work. 

b) Why use the terminal
	While this is my first time using the terminal and I am still new at learning the commands, I noticed that by using the commands I was able to do things faster. For example, to create a file I only needed to type touch file_name.file_type instead of having to open an app, type something on it and then save it. The most fascinating thing I learned was relocating a file or copying a file. Although it took me a while to get it, I was excited to see how a simple line could change the location of a file entirely. I look forward to getting to a point where I won't need to use the GUI to interact with my computer. 

c) Explain 3 benefits version control in your own words
	A version control system has many important benefits. The first one is that it allows multiple people to work on the same files, making collaboration more effective. Secondly, it allows for changes to be tracked in case something goes wrong with the current version so that the previous version can be recovered. Lastly, by being able to use the branching system we are able to have many versions of the same code. This allows for edits to happen in the staging branch before it is merged into the master.
